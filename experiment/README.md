# Experiment

This directory contains code used for Histogram Loss experiments in various problems. 

The Histogram Loss transforms, models, and hypermodels are based on the losses described and tested in [Imani 2019](https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/90c26ffa-6eff-4ac6-a011-9699d27d91d0/view/347e81b7-8f26-4acb-9960-044c8a2ee7db/Ehsan_Imani.pdf).

The models are implemented using [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
